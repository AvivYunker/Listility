This repository is dedicated to the final project of the Zionet course. The application enables the user to create lists, create tasks inside of them, and share the lists with other users.
The project relies on MERN technologies (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS).
The project was written by Aviv Yunker, Boris Sholkov and Netanel Adler.
